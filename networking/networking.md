# Networking Concepts

## VPN
- Creates a secure encrypted connection between your device and a remote server.  
- Used to protect your data when on public Wi-Fi networks or to access restricted content.  
- By routing traffic through a secure server, it masks the real IP address, making it look like browsing from another location.  
- Enhances privacy.  
- Hides real identity.  
- Protects against hackers.

## DNS
- Basically a phone book of the internet.  
- Translates domain names into corresponding IP addresses.  
- Without DNS, we would have to remember long IP addresses.  

---

## DHCP
- Responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices within a network.  

---

## NAT
- Used to modify the source and destination IP addresses of packets.  
- Allows multiple connected devices on a network to share a single IP address.  

---

## MAC
- Unique identifier assigned to each network interface card.  
- Used to connect devices on a network.  

---

## ARP
- Used to map IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses.  
- When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it sends ARP requests to find out the recipientâ€™s MAC address.  
- Ensures that data reaches the correct physical device.  

---

## ICMP
- Used for error reporting and diagnostic purposes.  

---

## VOIP
- Allows voice communication to be transmitted over the internet.  
- Cost-effective and provides high-quality communication.  

---

## VLAN
- Allows administrators to create logical networks inside a physical network.  
- Even when devices are on the same network, it helps isolate traffic between them.  

---

## Routers
- Devices that connect different networks such as a local network with the internet.  
- Use IP addresses to determine the best route for data to travel from one network to another.  

---

## Switch
- Connects multiple devices within the same network.  

---

## Firewalls
- Security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.  
- Acts as a barrier between the internal network and the external world.  
- Allows safe traffic based on predefined security rules.  
- Essential for protecting from cyber attacks, viruses, and malicious traffic.  

---

## Proxy
- Acts as an intermediary between a device and the internet.  
- Improves privacy.  
- Filters content.  
- Bypasses geographical restrictions by masking IP addresses and appearing as if browsing from another location.  

---

## BGP
- Manages how data is routed between different networks on the internet.  
- Responsible for determining the most efficient path for data to travel between large-scale networks.  

---

## QoS
- Used to manage network traffic.  
- Ensures applications receive priority over less time-sensitive data.  
- Helps guarantee that high-priority data travels with low latency and minimal jitter.  
- Improves services that work on real-time communication.

## OSI Model

### Physical Layer
- Deals with the physical transmission of data over media like cables or wireless signals.  

### Data Link Layer
- Ensures reliable communication between two devices by managing MAC addresses and data frames.  

### Network Layer
- Routes data to the correct destination based on IP addresses.  

### Transport Layer
- Ensures reliable end-to-end communication, providing flow control and error correction.  

### Session Layer
- Manages sessions and maintains the state of communication.  

### Presentation Layer
- Formats and encrypts the data for the application layer.  

### Application Layer
- Interacts with software programs to provide network services.

## WAN
- Spans a large geographical area connecting multiple LANs.  

---

## LAN
- Network confined to a small geographical area.  

---

## Load Balancer
- Distributes network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed with too much traffic.  
- Improves website uptime, performance, and scalability.  

---

## NFC
- Allows devices to exchange data over short distances.  
- Used for contactless payments.  

---

## MPLS
- Routing technique used in large networks to improve speed and efficiency of traffic.  
- Uses labels to make routing decisions instead of IP addresses.  

---

## SD-WAN
- Modern approach to managing wide area networks.  
- Uses software to control the flow of data across multiple connections.  
- Ensures better performance, cost-effectiveness, and security.

## IPv4
- Example: `192.168.0.1`  

---

## IPv6
- Example: `2002:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888`
