## 1. Unified Kill Chain — Overview

**Concept**  
A combined framework that merges attacker motivations, tactics, and methodologies (drawing from models like the Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, etc.). It explains how attackers plan, gain access, move through systems, and achieve objectives.

**Purpose / Why?**
- Understand, predict, and defend against attacks  
- Connect attacker actions, behavior, and goals into a single timeline  
- Useful for security operations and threat modeling

## 2. Threat Modeling (Steps)

1. **Identify** — What assets, threats, or vulnerabilities exist?  
2. **Assess** — Analyze risk, impact, and likelihood  
3. **Plan** — Strategy for mitigation, protection, and response  
4. **Policies / Controls** — Rules, configurations, procedures implemented

## 3. Unified Kill Chain — 18 Phases

1. **Reconnaissance** — Research target, gather information  
2. **Weaponization** — Create malware/tool/attack vector  
3. **Delivery** — Send malware (email, USB, link, etc.)  
4. **Social Engineering** — Manipulate or trick users  
5. **Exploitation** — Use vulnerability to gain access  
6. **Persistence** — Maintain access (backdoor, registry changes, etc.)  
7. **Defense Evasion** — Disable antivirus, logs, cover tracks  
8. **Command & Control (C2)** — Establish remote communication  
9. **Pivoting** — Move from one compromised system to another  
10. **Discovery** — Scan, map, identify systems and vulnerabilities  
11. **Privilege Escalation** — Gain admin/root access  
12. **Execution** — Run malware or commands  
13. **Credential Access** — Steal passwords, tokens, or hashes  
14. **Lateral Movement** — Spread to other systems  
15. **Collection** — Gather data, files, or information  
16. **Exfiltration** — Transfer data outside the network  
17. **Impact** — Modify, delete, encrypt data; cause disruption  
18. **Objective** — Final goal (financial gain, espionage, sabotage, etc.)
