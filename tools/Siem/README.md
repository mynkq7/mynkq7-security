## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### Overview

- **SIEM** stands for **Security Information and Event Management**.
- It provides **centralized logging** and **security visibility** across an organization.
- Collects and normalizes logs from multiple sources such as servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS, applications, and endpoints.
- Supports **risk management**, **threat detection**, and **regulatory compliance**.

## Key Functions

### Centralized Logging

- Aggregates logs and event data from various devices and systems into a single platform.
- Ensures all activity can be monitored, analyzed, and archived.

### Risk Management

- Streamlines remediation by using **advanced analytics** to detect patterns, identify potential threats, and prioritize alerts.

### Compliance

- Provides actionable reports, alerts, and audit trails to help maintain **regulatory compliance** (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

## SIEM Components

### 1. Collection

- Collects and parses data from various sources such as logs, network devices, endpoints, servers, and security tools.

### 2. Normalization

- Translates collected data into a **common format** for easier correlation and analysis.

### 3. Correlation

- Recognizes and groups related events to provide a **clear, contextual view** of security activity.
- Enables detection of complex attack patterns or multi-step intrusions.

### 4. Alerting

- Creates and sends **real-time alerts** of potential security incidents to the SOC or security team for immediate review.
