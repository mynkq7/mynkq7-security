# Log Analysis

## Log Files

### Overview

- **Log files** store events, processes, messages, and other data generated by applications, operating systems, or network devices.
- They provide detailed information about actions performed by users and systems.
- Log files play a crucial role in **monitoring**, **troubleshooting**, **security analysis**, and **incident response**.

---

### Importance of Log Files

- **Security Monitoring:** Detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
- **System Performance:** Identify errors, crashes, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Auditing and Compliance:** Maintain records for audit trails and regulatory requirements.
- **Incident Investigation:** Provide forensic evidence during threat analysis or breach investigations.

### Common Types of Log Files

| Log Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **System Logs** | Events generated by the operating system (e.g., startup, shutdown, errors). |
| **Application Logs** | Records of events and errors generated by software applications. |
| **Security Logs** | Authentication attempts, access control changes, and security-related events. |
| **Network Logs** | Logs from routers, firewalls, switches, IDS/IPS, and other network devices. |
| **Event Logs** | Windows-specific logs that capture system, security, and application events. |
| **Audit Logs** | Track administrative actions for compliance and accountability. |

## Explored: Logs

**Digital record of system, application, network, and security events.**

Captures activities like:
- Logins  
- Configuration changes  
- Traffic flows  
- Alerts

### Why It Is Important
- Detect threats early  
- Reconstruct incidents and trace attacker actions  
- Provide forensic evidence for investigations  
- Assist in troubleshooting and performance monitoring  

---

### How They Help
- Correlate events from multiple sources to uncover attack patterns  
- Give real-time visibility across IT infrastructure

## Detailed Types of Logs

### Windows Event Logs
> Contain system, security, and application events.  
> Essential for detecting authentication failures, policy changes, and malicious activity on systems.

### Linux System Logs
> Contain Linux system activities, authentication, and kernel events.

### Firewall Logs
> Contain network allow/deny decisions with source/destination details.  
> Critical for identifying unauthorized access attempts, port scans, and network anomalies.

### Proxy Server Logs
> Contain web traffic requests, URLs accessed, and user browsing behavior.  
> Monitor data exfiltration, malicious websites, and policy violations.

### Antivirus / EDR Logs
> Contain malware detection, quarantine actions, and endpoint behavioral analysis.  
> First line of defense against malware, ransomware, and advanced threats.

### Active Directory Logs
> Contain domain authentication, user/group changes, and directory service access.  
> Critical for detecting credential thefts, privilege escalation, and insider threats.

### VPN Logs
> Contain remote access connections, authentication attempts, and session details.  
> Monitor unauthorized remote access and unusual connection patterns.

### Cloud Security Logs
> Contain cloud service API calls, resource changes, and access patterns.  
> Essential for cloud security monitoring and compliance in hybrid environments.

### DNS Logs
> Contain domain name resolution requests and responses.  
> Detect command-and-control traffic, data exfiltration, and malicious domains.

### IDS / IPS Logs
> Contain IDPS alerts and blocked threats.

### Database Logs
> Contain database queries, transactions, authentication, and access patterns.  
> Protect sensitive data from attacks like SQL injection, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
